When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with other people for a project or when I want to start an public project. It can also be useful if I want to have access from different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I need to have full control over the files/code I am working on. If I modify code and in the meantime somebody else updates the files in the remote repository I don't want it to influence my current work by automatically updating my local files. Manually pulling the changes from GitHub gives me full control over that. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies from a GitHub repository to another (online copy). Clones are local copies either from another local repository or from an online source (e.g. GitHub). Branches are labels to indentify different paths in the program in order to split up or merge files at different points in time.
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You know what the differences between your version and the remote version is and if you are out of sync, ahead, or behind. Having a local copy allows you to investigate the changes and merge the versions without the need for an online connection.
